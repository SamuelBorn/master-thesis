    abstract = {We consider the problem of quickly computing shortest paths in
                weighted graphs. Often, this is achieved in two phases: (1)
                derive auxiliary data in an expensive preprocessing phase, and
                (2) use this auxiliary data to speed up the query phase. By
                adding a fast weight-customization phase, we extend Contraction
                Hierarchies to support a three-phase workflow. The expensive
                preprocessing is split into a phase exploiting solely the
                unweighted topology of the graph and a lightweight phase that
                adapts the auxiliary data to a specific weight. We achieve this
                by basing our Customizable Contraction Hierarchies ({CCHs}) on
                nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental
                analysis on large road and game maps showing that {CCHs} are a
                very practicable solution in scenarios where edge weights often
                change.},

    abstract = {We introduce {FlowCutter}, a novel algorithm to compute a set of
                edge cuts or node separators that optimize cut size and balance
                in the Pareto sense. Our core algorithm heuristically solves the
                balanced connected st -edge-cut problem, where two given nodes s
                and t must be separated by removing edges to obtain two connected
                parts. Using the core algorithm as a subroutine, we build
                variants that compute node separators that are independent of s
                and t . From the computed Pareto set, we can identify cuts with a
                particularly good tradeoff between cut size and balance that can
                be used to compute contraction and minimum fill-in orders, which
                can be used in Customizable Contraction Hierarchies ({CCHs}), a
                speed-up technique for shortest-path computations. Our core
                algorithm runs in O ( c ∣ E ∣) time, where E is the set of edges
                and c is the size of the largest outputted cut. This makes it
                well suited for separating large graphs with small cuts, such as
                road graphs, which is the primary application motivating our
                research. For road graphs, we present an extensive experimental
                study demonstrating that {FlowCutter} outperforms the current
                state of the art in terms of both cut sizes and {CCH}
                performance. By evaluating {FlowCutter} on a standard graph
                partitioning benchmark, we further show that {FlowCutter} also
                finds small, balanced cuts on nonroad graphs. Another application
                is the computation of small tree decompositions. To evaluate the
                quality of our algorithm in this context, we entered the {PACE}
                2016 challenge [13] and won first place in the corresponding
                sequential competition track. We can therefore conclude that our
                {FlowCutter} algorithm finds small, balanced cuts on a wide
                variety of graphs.},

                acceleration of shortest path queries in road networks using
                Customizable Contraction Hierarchies ({CCH}). It is based on
                computing a nested dissection order by recursively dividing the
                road network into parts. Recently, with {FlowCutter} and Inertial
                Flow, two flow-based graph bipartitioning algorithms have been
                proposed for road networks. While {FlowCutter} achieves
                high-quality results and thus fast query times, it is rather
                slow. Inertial Flow is particularly fast due to the use of
                geographical information while still achieving decent query
                times. We combine the techniques of both algorithms to achieve
                more than six times faster preprocessing times than {FlowCutter}
                and even faster queries on the Europe road network. We show that
                using 16 cores of a shared-memory machine, this preprocessing
                needs four minutes.},

                concept of node contraction. The nodes are first ordered by
                ‘importance’. A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively
                contracting the least important node. Contracting a node v means
                replacing shortest paths going through v by shortcuts. We obtain
                a hierarchical query algorithm using bidirectional shortest-path
                search. The forward search uses only edges leading to more
                important nodes and the backward search uses only edges coming
                from more important nodes. For fastest routes in road networks,
                the graph remains very sparse throughout the contraction process
                using rather simple heuristics for ordering the nodes. We have
                five times lower query times than the best previous hierarchical
                Dijkstra-based speedup techniques and a negative space overhead,
                i.e., the data structure for distance computation needs less
                space than the input graph. {CHs} can be combined with many other
                route planning techniques, leading to improved performance for
                many-to-many routing, transit-node routing, goal-directed routing
                or mobile and dynamic scenarios.},

    abstract = {This paper studies real-world road networks from an algorithmic
                perspective, focusing on empirical studies that yield useful
                properties of road networks that can be exploited in the design
                of fast algorithms that deal with geographic data. Unlike
                previous approaches, our study is not based on the assumption
                that road networks are planar graphs. Indeed, based on the a
                number of experiments we have performed on the road networks of
                the 50 United States and District of Columbia, we provide strong
                empirical evidence that road networks are quite non-planar. Our
                approach therefore instead is directed at finding
                algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as
                non-planar geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties
                of road networks that can still lead to efficient algorithms for
                such problems as shortest paths and Voronoi diagrams. In
                particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed graphs
                , which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood
                systems. This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for
                road networks without making any additional assumptions about the
                distribution of edge weights. In fact, our algorithms can allow
                for non-metric weights.},
