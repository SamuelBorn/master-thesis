	abstract = {We consider the problem of quickly computing shortest paths in weighted graphs. Often, this is achieved in two phases: (1) derive auxiliary data in an expensive preprocessing phase, and (2) use this auxiliary data to speed up the query phase. By adding a fast weight-customization phase, we extend Contraction Hierarchies to support a three-phase workflow. The expensive preprocessing is split into a phase exploiting solely the unweighted topology of the graph and a lightweight phase that adapts the auxiliary data to a specific weight. We achieve this by basing our Customizable Contraction Hierarchies ({CCHs}) on nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental analysis on large road and game maps showing that {CCHs} are a very practicable solution in scenarios where edge weights often change.},

It is based on computing a nested dissection order by recursively dividing the road network into parts. Recently, with {FlowCutter} and Inertial Flow, two flow-based graph bipartitioning algorithms have been proposed for road networks. While {FlowCutter} achieves high-quality results and thus fast query times, it is rather slow. Inertial Flow is particularly fast due to the use of geographical information while still achieving decent query times. We combine the techniques of both algorithms to achieve more than six times faster preprocessing times than {FlowCutter} and even faster queries on the Europe road network. We show that using 16 cores of a shared-memory machine, this preprocessing needs four minutes.},

A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively contracting the least important node. Contracting a node v means replacing shortest paths going through v by shortcuts. We obtain a hierarchical query algorithm using bidirectional shortest-path search. The forward search uses only edges leading to more important nodes and the backward search uses only edges coming from more important nodes. For fastest routes in road networks, the graph remains very sparse throughout the contraction process using rather simple heuristics for ordering the nodes. We have five times lower query times than the best previous hierarchical Dijkstra-based speedup techniques and a negative space overhead, i.e., the data structure for distance computation needs less space than the input graph. {CHs} can be combined with many other route planning techniques, leading to improved performance for many-to-many routing, transit-node routing, goal-directed routing or mobile and dynamic scenarios.},

Unlike previous approaches, our study is not based on the assumption that road networks are planar graphs. Indeed, based on the a number of experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States and District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road networks are quite non-planar. Our approach therefore instead is directed at finding algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as non-planar geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of road networks that can still lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and Voronoi diagrams. In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed graphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems. This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights. In fact, our algorithms can allow for non-metric weights.},

              This article introduces new algorithms for the uniform random generation of labelled planar graphs. Its principles rely on Boltzmann samplers, as recently developed by Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard, and Schaeffer. It combines the Boltzmann framework, a suitable use of rejection, a new combinatorial bijection found by Fusy, Poulalhon, and Schaeffer, as well as a precise analytic description of the generating functions counting planar graphs, which was recently obtained by Giménez and Noy. This gives rise to an extremely efficient algorithm for the random generation of planar graphs. There is a preprocessing step of some fixed small cost; and the expected time complexity of generation is quadratic for exact‐size uniform sampling and linear for uniform approximate‐size sampling. This greatly improves on the best previously known time complexity for exact‐size uniform sampling of planar graphs with
              n
              vertices, which was a little over

	abstract = {We study the point-to-point shortest path problem in a setting where preprocessing is allowed. We improve the reach-based approach of Gutman [17] in several ways. In particular, we introduce a bidirectional version of the algorithm that uses implicit lower bounds and we add shortcut arcs to reduce vertex reaches. Our modifications greatly improve both preprocessing and query times. The resulting algorithm is as fast as the best previous method, due to Sanders and Schultes [28]. However, our algorithm is simpler and combines in a natural way with A* search, which yields significantly better query times.},

Our algorithm preprocesses the eight digit number of nodes needed for maps of the {USA} or Western Europe in a few hours using linear space. Shortest (i.e. fastest) path queries then take around eight milliseconds to produce exact shortest paths. This is about 2 000 times faster than using Dijkstra’s algorithm.},

	abstract = {During recent years, impressive speed-up techniques for Dijkstra's have been developed. Unfortunately, the most advanced techniques use bidirectional search, which makes it hard to use them in scenarios where a backward search is prohibited. Even worse, such scenarios are widely spread (e.g., timetable-information systems or time-dependent networks).In this work, we present a unidirectional speed-up technique, which competes with bidirectional approaches. Moreover, we show how to exploit the advantage of unidirectional routing for fast exact queries in timetable information systems and for fast approximative queries in time-dependent scenarios. By running experiments on several inputs other than road networks, we show that our approach is very robust to the input.},

Starting from this informal observation, we developed an algorithmic approach, transit node routing, that allows us to reduce quickest path queries in road networks to a small number of table lookups. For road maps of Western Europe and the United States, our best query times improved over the best previously published figures by two orders of magnitude. This is also more than one million times faster than the best known algorithm for general networks.},
