\chapter{Synthetic Graph Generation for Feature Isolation}

To better understand the underlying reasons for the small separators observed in road networks, we investigate the influence of specific graph properties in isolation.
This chapter details our approach to generating synthetic graph classes that exhibit selected features characteristic of road networks, such as low average degree, specific degree distributions, or properties related to planarity and locality.
By analyzing the separator sizes within these synthetic graphs, we aim to determine which properties, or combinations thereof, are crucial for enabling small separators.

\section{Degree Distribution}

Our initial focus is on isolating the effect of the degree distribution.
Road networks are known to be sparse graphs.
The specific PTV Europe road network dataset \cite{ptv_group_dimacs-europe_2009} utilized in our experiments exhibits an average vertex degree of approximately \(2.5\).
A detailed visualization of the degree distribution for this network is provided in \cref{fig:degree_dist_europe}.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{graphics/degree_overview_europe.pdf}
	\caption{Degree distribution of the PTV Europe road network. The x-axis represents the vertex degree, and the y-axis shows the fraction of vertices with that degree. A single node with degree 12 has the highest degree.}
	\label{fig:degree_dist_europe}
\end{figure}

To examine whether this low average degree alone is sufficient to yield small separators, we generate connected random graphs matching this average degree.
The generation process involves two main steps.
First, a random spanning tree is created for a given set of \(n\) vertices using the algorithm described by Broder \cite{broder_generating_1989}.
This algorithm performs a random walk starting from an arbitrary vertex on the complete graph of \(n\) vertices.
An edge becomes part of the spanning tree the first time a vertex is discovered via that edge during the walk.
The process continues until all vertices are visited, resulting in a uniformly sampled random spanning tree in expected time \bigO{n \log n}.

It is noteworthy that random trees generated in this manner exhibit properties distinct from those of road networks.
For instance, the diameter of such random trees is known to be in \bigO{n^{1/2}} \cite{chlamtac_tree-based_1987}.
This differs from empirical observations on road networks, such as subgraphs from the nested dissection of the Karlsruhe graph, where the diameter appears smaller, estimated empirically as \bigO{n^{0.3683}}.
This observed diameter growth is visualized in \cref{fig:diameter_karlsruhe}.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{graphics/diameters.pdf}
	\caption{Empirical diameter growth observed in the Karlsruhe road network subgraph. The plot shows the diameter (y-axis) as a function of the number of nodes \(n\) (x-axis, log scale).}
	\label{fig:diameter_karlsruhe}
\end{figure}

Following the generation of the initial random spanning tree, we proceed to the second step: adding edges randomly between pairs of non-adjacent vertices.
This edge addition continues until the target average degree of \(2.5\) is reached for the entire graph.
The resulting graphs, by construction, lack the inherent locality often present in road networks.
A consequence of adding these random edges is a notable decrease in the graph diameter.
For example, graphs generated with one million nodes using this method exhibit diameters of approximately 40.

These synthetic graphs do not replicate the small separator sizes observed in real-world road networks.
Experiments yielded large top-level separators, whose sizes scaled approximately linearly with the graph size \(n\), i.e., as \bigO{n}.
However, separators found during subsequent recursive partitioning behaved differently: their sizes were significantly smaller than this linear trend would predict for the corresponding subgraph sizes.
We attribute this deviation to structural changes in the subgraphs induced by the partitioning process.
Specifically, the large top-level separators often remove a significant fraction of the non-tree edges that were originally added to achieve the target average degree of approximately \(2.5\) in the parent graph.
Consequently, the resulting subgraphs become sparser—our observations showed a decrease in average degree to approximately \(2.2\)—and increasingly dominated by their underlying tree structure.
This shift means these subgraphs effectively belong to a different, more tree-like graph class than initially generated, which naturally leads to smaller relative separator sizes.
The separator scaling is illustrated in \cref{fig:same_degree}.



\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{graphics/RandomAvgDeg2.5.pdf}
	\caption{Separator sizes observed in random graphs generated with an average degree matching the PTV Europe road network (\( \approx 2.5 \)).}
	\label{fig:same_degree}
\end{figure}

We also conducted experiments to generate graphs that match not just the average degree but also the specific degree distribution of a reference road network.
This process involved starting with a random tree and then adding edges subject to constraints: an edge \((u, v)\) was incorporated only if doing so would not cause either vertex \(u\) or \(v\) to exceed the degree count specified for them by the target distribution, which was sampled from the road network.
The separator results from this more refined approach were largely similar to those from graphs matching only the average degree.

It is important to note, however, that precisely replicating a target degree distribution with this method is not possible.
While the maximum degree in the generated graphs generally aligns with that of the reference network, discrepancies emerge, particularly for nodes with higher degrees.
The underlying random spanning tree structure tends to produce a higher proportion of such nodes compared to actual road networks.
For instance, in synthetic graphs designed to match the Europe dataset \cite{ptv_group_dimacs-europe_2009}, approximately 1.8\% of vertices had a degree of 5 or greater, exceeding the 0.2\% observed in the real dataset.
Thus, our process achieves an approximation of the target distribution.
Nevertheless, we posit that this approximation is sufficiently close for our investigation, as the relatively small fraction of vertices with degrees deviating from the target constraints is unlikely to fundamentally alter the observed separator scaling behavior for this graph class.

These findings reinforce the suggestion that the specific degree distribution, in isolation, is likely insufficient to fully explain the empirically observed small separators.
Nevertheless, the low average degree remains a noteworthy property.
While a lower average degree may not fundamentally alter the inherent asymptotic separator scaling characteristic of a specific graph class, it often correlates with smaller constant factors in the observed separator sizes; the practical effect of sparsity on separator magnitudes will be discussed further in a subsequent section.

Beyond the influence of average degree on constant factors, it is also crucial to recognize that neither a low average degree nor a specific sparse degree distribution are strict prerequisites for achieving small separators.
Indeed, graphs can be constructed that possess both deliberately small separators (as a function of \(n\)) and a high average degree.
Consider, for instance, the following recursive graph generation scheme designed to produce a graph on \(n\) vertices with a target separator of size \(s(n)\) (e.g., \(s(n) = n^{1/3}\)):
First, a separator clique \(S\) on \(s(n)\) vertices, denoted \(K_{s(n)}\), is designated.
Then, two subgraphs, \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), each containing approximately \((n-s(n))/2\) vertices, are generated recursively by the same procedure (with a base case, such as returning a clique \(K_n\), for small \(n\), e.g., when \(n \le 2\)).
Finally, every vertex in \(G_1\) is connected to every vertex in \(S\), and likewise, every vertex in \(G_2\) is connected to every vertex in \(S\).
By construction, the set \(S\) (forming a \(K_{s(n)}\)) is a separator of size \(s(n)\) that partitions the graph into \(G_1\) and \(G_2\).
Despite this small, built-in separator, the average degree of the resulting graph can be substantial.
For example, using \(s(n) = n^{1/3}\), a graph of \(n=10,000\) vertices generated via this method has an average degree of approximately 169 and a maximum degree of 6202.
This example illustrates that specific structural properties enabling small separators can coexist with high overall edge density, suggesting that the global organization of edges, beyond mere sparsity, significantly influences separator characteristics.

\section{Locality}
\label{sec:synthetic:locality}

Our investigation into locality begins by exploring how \enquote{closeness} defined by an existing network structure, rather than by direct geometric proximity in an embedding, influences graph properties.

\paragraph{Tree Locality}
For this first approach, we simulate locality by considering distances within an initial random spanning tree, which serves as a foundational sparse connected graph.
The premise is that vertices closer to each other along paths in this underlying tree are more likely candidates for new, direct connections, potentially reflecting how topological proximity in an existing network might drive the addition of new links.
To implement this, we begin by generating a random spanning tree using Broder's algorithm \cite{broder_generating_1989}.
Subsequently, edges are added between non-adjacent vertices until a target average degree, chosen as \(2.5\) to approximate that of road networks, is achieved.
To incorporate this form of locality, the probability of adding an edge between two vertices \(u\) and \(v\) is made dependent on their distance \( \text{dist}_T(u, v) \) within this initial spanning tree \(T\).
Specifically, we select a random vertex \(x\) and choose a second vertex \(y\) with a probability related to \(f(\text{dist}_T(x, y))\), where \(f\) is a decreasing function.

The computation of tree distances \(\text{dist}_T(x, y)\) for numerous candidate pairs \((x,y)\) is a critical step in this edge addition phase.
Initially, for each randomly selected vertex \(x\) and potential neighbor \(y\), a Breadth-First Search (BFS) is performed within the tree \(T\) to find \(\text{dist}_T(x, y)\).
While BFS on a tree is linear in the number of vertices \(n\), repeated invocations for many pairs prove computationally intensive for larger graphs.
To accelerate this, we adopt an approach based on Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) queries.
This involves an initial precomputation of an LCA data structure for the tree \(T\), which can be achieved in \bigO{n \log n} time (e.g., using an Euler tour and sparse table for Range Minimum Queries, enabling \bigO{1} query time).
Once the LCA of two nodes \(u\) and \(v\) is known, their tree distance is given by \(\text{dist}_T(u, v) = \text{depth}(u) + \text{depth}(v) - 2 \cdot \text{depth}(lca(u,v))\).
Although a single BFS is also linear, this LCA-based method yields a significant speedup, due to improved parallelization opportunities for the overall process.
Nevertheless, even with this optimization, the approach of potentially considering many \(y\) candidates for each \(x\) (full sampling) remains slow for large graphs.
We also test capping the BFS search for \(y\) (e.g., after a fixed number of hops or visited nodes, such as 50,000) as a potential optimization.
However, this leads to an artificial steep cutoff in the observed separator characteristics once graph or component sizes effectively exceed the scale imposed by this search limit.

Experiments exploring various decay functions \(f\) yield diverse results.
Simple functions like \( f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist} \) result in graphs that still exhibit large top-level separators scaling as \bigO{n}, although subgraphs from nested dissection show the previously noted super-linear decrease in separator size.
Conversely, rapidly decaying functions like \( f(\text{dist}) = 2^{-\text{dist}} \) produce graphs with separators of almost constant size, likely because the graph structure remains very close to that of the initial tree, with insufficient long-range connections.
Through further experimentation and fine-tuning, it is found that a function of the form \( f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist}^{3.3} \) is able to produce separator sizes that closely approximate the desired \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling (see \cref{fig:tree_dist_best_fit_scaling}).
\cref{fig:tree_dist_locality_scaling} provides a visual comparison of the separator sizes for various decay functions.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]

    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}

        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphics/tree_local_pow_overview.pdf}

        \label{fig:tree_dist_compare_functions}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}

        \caption{Separator scaling for \(f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist}^{3.3}\) with line fit.}
        \label{fig:tree_dist_best_fit_scaling}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Separator size scaling for graphs generated with tree-distance based locality, comparing various decay functions and highlighting the fit for \(f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist}^{3.3}\).}
    \label{fig:tree_dist_locality_scaling}
\end{figure}

Despite achieving the target scaling with \(f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist}^{3.3}\), this result offers limited insight into the intrinsic structural properties of real road networks that lead to their small separators.
The success with this specific, empirically derived exponent appears to be more a consequence of parameter tuning within this particular generative model (a random tree backbone augmented by edges based on tree distance) rather than an elucidation of fundamental graph characteristics.
While the general concept of incorporating locality based on distances within an existing network structure remains potentially insightful—as such a metric might capture aspects beyond mere Euclidean distance, like travel time reduction incentives—our preliminary results with simpler functions indicate a high sensitivity to the choice of \(f\).
Identifying a theoretically grounded or easily interpretable function \(f\) that consistently produces \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling proves non-trivial.
Given these considerations and the decision to prioritize other structural properties like geometric locality, planarity, and explicit hierarchy, we opt not to pursue an exhaustive search for an optimal or more interpretable tree-distance decay function within the scope of this work.

Achieving the target \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling with an empirically derived function like \(f(\text{dist}) = 1/\text{dist}^{3.3}\) appears to be an outcome of model-specific parameter tuning rather than a revelation of intrinsic road network properties responsible for their small separators.

\paragraph{Geometric Locality}

Our second approach incorporates geometric locality directly.
The core idea is to construct a graph starting with a basic connected structure and then augment it by adding only edges that connect geometrically close vertices, until a target average degree (e.g., \(2.5\)) is achieved.
To establish a meaningful threshold for 'closeness', we relate it to the natural scale derived from the spatial distribution of points.
Specifically, we first sample \(n\) points uniformly within a defined spatial domain (e.g., a circle).
We then compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of these points using Euclidean distances, via Kruskal's algorithm \cite{kruskal_shortest_1956}.
The maximum edge length found within this MST, denoted \(\ell_{\max}\), serves as our threshold distance, capturing a characteristic length scale of the initial sparse connection of the points.
The graph generation then proceeds by initially taking the edges of the MST.
Subsequently, additional edges \((u, v)\) between non-adjacent vertices are iteratively added, but crucially, only if their Euclidean distance is less than or equal to the threshold \(\ell_{\max}\).
This edge addition process continues until the overall graph reaches the target average degree of \(2.5\).
For efficient implementation of the edge addition step, we utilize spatial queries: for a randomly selected vertex \(u\), we query for potential neighbors \(v\) within the radius \(\ell_{\max}\) and randomly select one to connect to, avoiding multi-edges and self-loops.

Despite incorporating this explicit geometric constraint, the resulting synthetic graphs fail to exhibit the desired small separator sizes characteristic of road networks.
To analyze the separator properties of these graphs, we computed recursive separators.
Implementations from both IntertialFlowCutter and KaHIP were utilized for this purpose.
Our experiments using these methods indicate that separators in these geometrically generated graphs scale approximately as \bigO{n^{1/2}}.
This outcome is visualized in \cref{fig:geometric_locality_separators}.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\begin{subfigure}{0.35\linewidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphics/local_embedding.png}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Synthetic graph generation using geometric locality and analysis of separator sizes. }
	\label{fig:geometric_locality_separators}
\end{figure}

The results from the geometric locality approach suggest that merely combining low average degree with this specific form of locality is insufficient to reproduce the cubic root separator sizes of road networks.

\paragraph{Real-World Implications}

It is worth considering the practical implications of different asymptotic growth rates for separator sizes within the typical scale of road networks.
While \bigO{c_1\cdot n^{1/3}} and \bigO{c_2 \cdot n^{1/2}}, with \(c_2 \ll c1\), diverge for large \(n\), the actual separator sizes for graphs up to around 20 million vertices are similar.
The performance of algorithms leveraging graph separators in real-world applications may be more influenced by the absolute sizes of separators achievable in practice, compared to a specific scaling model.
Performance gains, for example for CCH \cite{dibbelt_customizable_2016}, could potentially be realized even if the separators behave like \(c \cdot n^{1/2}\) for a sufficiently small \(c\), as the absolute separator sizes remain manageable for networks of practical relevance.

\paragraph{Initial Deviations in Separator Scaling}

An interesting characteristic is observable for graphs with small node counts in empirical studies of road networks.
As a careful reader may notice in \cref{fig:separator_size_loglog_non_binned}, real road networks often exhibit a deviation in separator scaling for graphs containing approximately \(2^6\) nodes.
\cref{fig:outlier_histograms} presents histogram plots to better visualize the prevalence of these instances for both real-world data and our synthetic model.
Specifically, \cref{fig:real_europe_hist} shows this phenomenon for European road network samples.
These plots reveal an initial peak in relative separator size for small graphs, followed by a slight decrease, before the data align with the more dominant scaling trend observed for larger graphs.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.48\linewidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphics/Germany-hist.pdf}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Histograms illustrating the distribution of separator sizes, comparing real road networks (left) and the geometric locality model (right). A slight increase in separator size is observed for graphs with \(\approx 2^6\) nodes.}
	\label{fig:outlier_histograms}
\end{figure}

Our synthetic graphs generated using the geometric locality approach exhibit a similar initial pattern, as can be discerned from the histogram in \cref{fig:local_embedding_hist}.
This initial behavior in the synthetic model appears qualitatively comparable, although slightly more pronounced than in the real network data.
This correspondence is noteworthy.
It suggests that the geometric locality model, despite failing to replicate the overall asymptotic separator scaling of \bigO{n^{1/3}}, may capture certain structural properties relevant at smaller graph scales that are present in actual road networks.




\paragraph{Minimum Spanning Trees from Higher-Dimensional Embeddings}
\label{sec:synthetic:mst}
Observing that real road networks often exhibit diameters smaller than the \bigO{n^{1/2}} found in our random tree models, we sought to determine if an initial tree structure with an intrinsically smaller diameter could lead to graphs with correspondingly smaller separators after edge augmentation.
This motivated an exploration of generating initial trees as Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) of points sampled in \(d\)-dimensional Euclidean space, since the diameter of such an MST on \(n\) random points in \(d\)-space (for \(d \ge 2\)) is typically \bigO{n^{1/d}}.
Our experiments focused on the case where \(d=3\), for which the MST diameter is approximately \bigO{n^{1/3}}.
This involved sampling \(n\) points uniformly in 3D space and computing their MST.
When edges were subsequently added to such 3D-MSTs to achieve a target average degree, the resulting graphs exhibited separators that scaled as \bigO{n^{2/3}}.
This scaling aligns with a general geometric intuition: a \(d\)-dimensional hypervolume containing \(n\) points is naturally bisected by a \((d-1)\)-dimensional separator.
If the characteristic linear extent of the volume is proportional to \(n^{1/d}\), the \((d-1)\)-dimensional measure (e.g., area for \(d=3\), length for \(d=2\)) of such a separator would be proportional to \((n^{1/d})^{d-1} = n^{(d-1)/d}\).
For \(d=2\), this yields the familiar \bigO{n^{1/2}} scaling for planar-like separators, and for our \(d=3\) experiment, it corresponds to the observed \bigO{n^{2/3}}.
While this suggests a general hypothesis that augmenting MSTs from \(d\)-dimensional point sets might lead to graphs with \bigO{n^{(d-1)/d}} separators, this avenue was not pursued further.
Since for \(d=3\) the \bigO{n^{2/3}} separators do not offer an improvement over the \bigO{n^{1/2}} separators of planar graphs in the context of finding exceptionally small separators (and higher dimensions \(d > 3\) would yield even larger exponents as \((d-1)/d \to 1\)), this specific line of inquiry was not extended.






\section{Planarity}
\label{sec:synthetic:planarity}

We examine separator properties in two classes of planar graphs: grids and Delaunay triangulations.
These serve as fundamental theoretical models for planar structures relevant to the study of road networks due to their near-planarity.
In our study, these graph classes are sparsified to achieve a low average degree (approximately \(2.5\)), reflecting the sparsity observed in road networks.

\subsection{Grids}
\label{sec:synthetic:grid}

Our initial investigation focuses on grid graphs, a fundamental class known to possess separators scaling as \bigO{n^{1/2}}.
To align their sparsity with road networks, we generate modified grids with an average degree of approximately \(2.5\).
The generation process starts with a square two-dimensional grid graph.
Edges are then removed uniformly at random until the target average degree is reached over the entire graph.
Subsequently, we identify and utilize the largest connected component for analysis.
We observe that even without explicit mechanisms to prevent disconnection during edge removal, the largest connected component typically encompasses a large fraction of the initial vertices.

Analysis of these sparse grid graphs reveals separator sizes consistent with the \bigO{n^{1/2}} asymptotic behavior of complete grids.
However, the constant factor associated with this scaling appears to be relatively small.
Consequently, although the asymptotic limit behavior differs from the \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling empirically observed for road networks, the absolute separator sizes in these sparse grids are numerically similar to those of road networks for graphs up to typical sizes (e.g., around 20 million nodes).
This finding highlights that sparsity, even within a simple planar structure like a grid, can lead to separators that are small in absolute terms for practical graph dimensions.
\Cref{fig:sparse_grid_separators} illustrates a sample sparse grid and the observed separator scaling.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Analysis of sparse grid graphs with average degree \(2.5\).}
	\label{fig:sparse_grid_separators}
\end{figure}


Analogous to the earlier example where dense graphs were constructed with a specific separator function, it is also possible to engineer grid-like graphs to exhibit a target separator scaling, such as \(\bigO{n^{1/3}}\).
This approach involves a recursive construction: two smaller grid-like subgraphs, \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), each comprising approximately \(n/2\) vertices, are generated recursively.
These subgraphs are then interconnected.
Instead of forming dense connections or connecting all border vertices, a controlled number of edges, specifically chosen to match the desired separator size (e.g., approximately \(n^{1/3}\) for the combined graph of size \(n\)), are added between \(G_1\) and \(G_2\).
For instance, this can be achieved by selecting approximately \(n^{1/3}\) nodes along the boundary of one subgraph and connecting each to its closest corresponding node on the boundary of the other.
The set of these inter-connecting edges (or one of their incident vertices) is, by construction, a separator of the desired \(\bigO{n^{1/3}}\) size.
An example of such a graph and its resulting separator scaling is illustrated in \cref{fig:engineered_grid_sep}.
While this method demonstrates that specific separator sizes can be achieved by deliberate construction in grid-like structures, it offers limited insight into which intrinsic graph properties of real road networks lead to their empirically observed small separators.
The desired scaling is explicitly engineered into the generation process here, rather than emerging naturally from more fundamental characteristics.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Grid-like graph with engineered separators designed to scale as \(\bigO{n^{1/3}}\).}
    \label{fig:engineered_grid_sep}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Delaunay Triangulations}
\label{sec:synthetic:delaunay}

We extend this investigation to Delaunay triangulations, which can be viewed as a generalization of grids derived from point sets.
Our process involves sampling points uniformly at random in a two-dimensional space and computing their Delaunay triangulation.
The Delaunay triangulation results in a graph with an average vertex degree of approximately 6, which is denser than typical road networks.
This density is consistent with properties of triangulations; for a planar graph forming a triangulation of \(|V|\) vertices, Euler's formula (\(|V| - |E| + |F| = 2\), where \(|F|\) is the number of faces) combined with the observation that \(3|F| \approx 2|E|\) (since most faces are triangles and each edge borders two faces) implies that the average degree \(2|E|/|V|\) approaches 6 for large \(|V|\).
Similar to the grid experiments, we thus randomly delete edges from the triangulation until the average degree reaches the target value of \(2.5\), again analyzing the largest connected component.

As might be expected, the results obtained from these sparse Delaunay graphs are largely analogous to those from sparse grids.
The separators exhibit scaling consistent with \bigO{n^{1/2}}, characteristic of planar graphs, yet the associated constant factors are small.
This again leads to absolute separator sizes that are numerically comparable to those measured in road networks for graphs of relevant sizes.
These findings are depicted in \cref{fig:sparse_delaunay_separators}.

	\caption{Analysis of sparse Delaunay graphs with average degree \(2.5\).}
	\label{fig:sparse_delaunay_separators}
\end{figure}

The experiments with sparse grids and Delaunay triangulations suggest that combining geometry with low average degree results in graphs whose practical separator sizes are close to those of road networks, despite differing asymptotic scaling.

\section{Highway Dimension}
\label{sec:synthetic:highway_dimension}

Given that the simpler graph models explored in previous sections do not reproduce the observed \bigO{n^{1/3}} separator scaling of road networks, we turn our attention to more complex generative processes designed to capture other relevant structural properties.
One such property is highway dimension, introduced by Abraham et al. \cite{abraham_highway_2010}.
Intuitively, a graph possesses a small highway dimension if, for every radius \(r > 0\), there exists a sparse set of vertices \(S_r\) such that every shortest path longer than \(r\) intersects \(S_r\).
A set is considered sparse if every ball of radius \(\mathcal{O}(r)\) contains only a small number of vertices from \(S_r\) \cite{abraham_highway_2010}.
The significance of this property stems from the finding that low highway dimension provides provable performance guarantees for several important route planning algorithms, including REACH \cite{goldberg_reach_2006}, Contraction Hierarchies \cite{geisberger_contraction_2008}, Highway Hierarchies \cite{sanders_highway_2005}, Transit Node Routing \cite{bast_fast_2007}, and SHARC \cite{bauer_sharc_2010}.

The work introducing highway dimension also proposes a synthetic graph generator (henceforth ABR generator) intended to produce graphs exhibiting this property \cite{abraham_highway_2010}.
A good explanation of the generation process is provided in \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}, which we summarize here.
The generation process operates iteratively.
It begins with an empty graph \( G = (V, E) = (\emptyset, \emptyset) \) and progressively adds new vertices \(v_t\) to \(V\), whose locations in the metric space are chosen randomly.
Throughout this process, the generator maintains a series of \(2^i\)-covers, denoted \(C_i\), for each level \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \log D\), and \(D\) represents the diameter of the metric space.
A set \(C_i \subseteq V\) is a \(2^i\)-cover if any two vertices \(u, v \in C_i\) satisfy \(d(u, v) \geq 2^i\), and every vertex \(u \in V\) is within distance \(2^i\) of some vertex in \(C_i\).
When a new vertex \(v_t\) is added, the generator identifies the smallest index \(i\) such that there exists a vertex \(w \in C_i\) with \(d(v_t, w) \leq 2^i\).
The new vertex \(v_t\) is then added to all covers \(C_j\) for which \(0 \leq j < i\).
If no such index \(i\) exists, \(v_t\) is added to all cover sets \(C_j\).
Edges are subsequently added based on these covers and a tuning parameter \(k\).
For each cover \(C_j\) containing \(v_t\) (where \(0 \leq j < i\)), and for each existing vertex \(w \in C_j\), an edge \((w, v_t)\) is added if their distance satisfies \(d(w, v_t) \leq k \cdot 2^j\).
Furthermore, for each \(C_j\) containing \(v_t\) where \(j < \log D\) and \(v_t\) is also present in \(C_{j+1}\), an edge is added connecting \(v_t\) to its nearest neighbor within the set \(C_{j+1}\).
For our experiments, we adopt parameter settings similar to those used by \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}, setting the diameter \(D = 2^{25}\) and the connection parameter \(k = \sqrt{2}\).

Bauer et al. also describe an alternative node sampling strategy aimed at creating structures resembling city clusters \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}.
We implement and test both the uniform random sampling and this cluster-based sampling approach.
Our experiments indicate no significant difference in the resulting separator sizes between the two sampling methods using the ABR generator framework.

The analysis of graphs generated using the ABR method yields separators that scale approximately as \bigO{n^{1/2}}.
This result is noteworthy because graphs generated by this process are typically highly non-planar.
It serves as a reminder that observing \bigO{n^{1/2}} separator scaling does not necessarily imply planarity.
\Cref{fig:abr_graph_separators} provides a visual example of an ABR-generated graph and illustrates the observed separator scaling.

\section{Hierarchical Structure}

Real-world road networks intrinsically possess a hierarchical structure.
Different types of roads cater to different travel distances and volumes, forming levels within the network.
Depending on the specific taxonomy used, road networks are categorized into various numbers of classes or levels.
For instance, a common classification for Germany includes (using original German terms alongside translations):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Federal Motorways (Bundesautobahnen)
	\item Federal Highways (Bundesstraßen)
	\item State Roads (Landesstraßen)
	      % \item District Roads (Kreisstraßen)
	\item Municipal Roads (Gemeindestraßen)
\end{itemize}

This inherent hierarchy is another potentially relevant feature influencing separator sizes, which we investigate using synthetic models.

\subsection{Voronoi-Based Hierarchical Generator}

One approach to generating synthetic networks with hierarchical features follows the method proposed by Bauer et al. \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}.
This method utilizes Voronoi diagrams iteratively.
A Voronoi diagram, given a set of points \(P\), partitions the plane into convex regions, where each region contains the area closer to one point in \(P\) than to any other point in \(P\).
The generation process commences within a predefined initial polygon, which defines the spatial extent of the synthetic network.
Points, designated as sites \(P\), are then generated within this polygon according to a chosen sampling strategy.
One strategy involves sampling a specified number of points uniformly at random throughout the polygon's interior.
Alternatively, to better emulate settlement patterns, a clustered sampling approach can be employed.
This approach involves first sampling locations for a number of population centers within the polygon.
Each center is then assigned characteristics, such as a population size or an influence radius, drawn from a chosen distribution.
Subsequently, points are sampled in the vicinity of each city center, concentrated within its influence radius, with the number of points related to the city's size.

Regardless of the sampling method, the resulting set of points \(P\) serves as the input for computing the Voronoi diagram for this initial level.
The Voronoi diagram partitions the polygon into regions based on nearest-neighbor relationships to the points in \(P\).
The edges of this Voronoi diagram (where adjacent regions meet) are then added to the synthetic graph.
To introduce hierarchy, some of the resulting Voronoi regions (polygons) are selected, and the process is recursively applied within them: new points are sampled inside the selected region (using either uniform or clustered sampling), and a new Voronoi diagram is constructed within its boundaries, adding further edges to the graph.

Phase two of the generation process addresses the density of the graph \(G\) resulting from the Voronoi tessellation by constructing a sparse graph \(t\)-spanner \(H\).
A subgraph \(H\) is a \(t\)-spanner of \(G\) if it preserves all pairwise distances up to a multiplicative factor of \(t\).
The spanner is built using a greedy algorithm that iterates through the edges of \(G\) sorted by non-increasing length (longest first).
An edge \((u, v)\) with length \(len(u, v)\) is added to the spanner \(H\) only if the current shortest path distance between \(u\) and \(v\) within \(H\), denoted \(dist_H(u, v)\), is greater than \(t \cdot len(u, v)\).
To compute \(dist_H(u, v)\), Dijkstra's algorithm is employed.
Additionally, a union-find data structure maintains the connected components of \(H\), allowing for immediate addition of edges connecting previously disconnected vertices.
Bauer et al. propose processing edges in non-increasing order (longest first) as a heuristic primarily intended to improve the computational efficiency of the spanner construction; the idea is to handle long edges while the intermediate spanner graph \(H\) is still sparse, potentially speeding up distance computations \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}.
We observe that our pruning strategy, the specifics of which are presented in a later section in \cref{alg:prune_edges}, tends to yield graph structures more visually akin to real-world road networks compared to the Bauer et al. method, although this involves an increased computational expense.

This generation method introduces artifacts.
For example, connections between major structures defined at higher levels (like large "cities") might be unrealistically sparse, potentially consisting of only a few edges.
Another artifact is that higher-level Voronoi edges (e.g., "highways" separating major regions) act as hard boundaries that lower-level edges (within regions) often do not cross, creating unrealistically effective separators along these top-level edges.

Analyzing separators in the final sparse graphs generated by this Voronoi-based method reveals interesting characteristics related to the hierarchy.
Plots of separator size versus subgraph size often exhibit noticeable local minima, which appear to correspond to the transitions between the hierarchical layers created during generation.
This can lead to separators of approximately constant size when partitioning cuts primarily occur between these major structures at layer intersections.
Within a single layer generated by the Voronoi tessellation (before sparsification), the separators tend to exhibit scaling closer to \bigO{n^{1/2}}.
Consequently, if the recursion depth is limited and the highest-level structures are allowed to grow large, their \bigO{n^{1/2}} separator behavior will dominate the separator size scaling.
\Cref{fig:voronoi_hierarchy} illustrates the structure and separator behavior of the final sparse graph.

	\label{fig:voronoi_hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Nested Grids}

To explore hierarchical effects in a more controlled manner, we also investigate a simpler but conceptually related approach using nested grids.
This method aims to construct a hierarchical graph by recursively embedding grid graphs within the cells of a parent grid, potentially allowing us to deliberately engineer specific separator scaling properties.
The fundamental idea involves placing copies of a subgraph (e.g., a square grid) into selected cells of a higher-level grid.
This resulting composite graph can then itself be treated as a subgraph to be placed within cells of a grid at an even higher level, and so on.
\cref{fig:nested_grid_analysis} shows a small conceptual example of a nested grid with three layers.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.35\linewidth}
		\centering

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Analysis of synthetic graphs generated using the nested grid approach.}
	\label{fig:nested_grid_analysis}
\end{figure}

A nested grid construction with \(l\) layers is determined by \(l\) grid sizes (specifying the dimensions of the grid at each layer) and \(l-1\) placement parameters (specifying how many subgraphs from layer \(i+1\) are placed within layer \(i\)).
This parameterization offers the possibility of attempting to enforce a target separator scaling, such as \bigO{n^{1/3}}, by carefully choosing the parameters at each level transition.
We assume that separating the nested structure primarily involves cutting through the top-level grid structure.
If the number of embedded subgraphs is not excessively large, the separator size might be approximated by the width \(w\) of the top-level grid, similar to a standard grid separator.
We can then estimate the total number of vertices \(|V|\) at a given stage based on the grid width \(w\) of the current layer, the number \(k\) of subgraphs placed within its cells, and the size \(s\) of each subgraph:
\[ |V| \approx w^2 + k \cdot s \]
This estimate is approximate as it may double-count vertices along the boundaries where subgraphs connect to the parent grid.
To enforce \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling specifically at this layer transition, we can equate the separator size (approximated by \(w\)) with \(|V|^{1/3}\):
\[ w \approx (|V|)^{1/3} \approx (w^2 + ks)^{1/3} \]
This leads to the cubic equation \( w^3 - w^2 - ks = 0 \).
If we fix the subgraph count \(k\) and subgraph size \(s\), we can solve for the grid width \(w\) required to satisfy this condition at the transition.
One root of this cubic equation for \(w\) is given by:
\[ w = \frac{(27 k s + \sqrt{(27 k s + 2)^2 - 4} + 2)^{1/3}}{3 \cdot 2^{1/3}} + \frac{2^{1/3}}{3 (27 k s + \sqrt{(27 k s + 2)^2 - 4} + 2)^{1/3}} + \frac{1}{3} \]

By carefully selecting \(w\) based on \(k\) and \(s\) using this relationship at each hierarchical level, one can attempt to construct a graph where the separator size scales roughly as the cube root of the number of nodes at each layer transition.
This controlled approach allows the local minima in separator sizes, already seen in the Voronoi method, to be made more pronounced and regular, as all subgraphs at a given level transition can be designed with the same size \(s\).
However, achieving a consistent overall \bigO{n^{1/3}} scaling for the entire graph across all sizes \(n\) remains a challenge.

The observed local minima in separator size occur systematically at the transitions between hierarchical levels.
This is because the construction method inherently creates sparse connections between components defined at different levels.
\cref{fig:nested_grid_connectivity_example} provides a simplified illustration of this principle, showing two example components from the same levels within the hierarchy, not the entire structure of a layer.
In this specific illustration, the components (represented by nodes 1-4 and 5-8) are linked only by the edges (3)--(5) and (4)--(6).
Consequently, removing just one endpoint from each connecting edge suffices to disconnect them.
This demonstrates how a vertex separator of small, constant size (size 2) exists between levels, regardless of the internal size of the components themselves.
Such constant-size separators at every level transition are the underlying cause of the pronounced local minima observed in the separator scaling plots for these nested structures.

\section{Hierarchical Delaunay Graph Generation}
\label{sec:hierarchical_delaunay_generation}

Our efforts to generate synthetic graphs with realistic road network properties, particularly small separators, led us to refine techniques inspired by prior work on synthetic road network generation, such as that of Bauer et al. \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}.
A significant artifact observed in some Voronoi-based hierarchical models was that major transport arteries, analogous to motorways, could not be realistically crossed by lower-level roads.
This limitation arose because new expansion sites were generated strictly within the polygonal cells defined by the higher-level Voronoi tessellation, effectively making top-level Voronoi edges hard boundaries.
Our revised core idea allows new centers of expansion to emerge from the existing network infrastructure itself; thus, new expansion sites are selected from the nodes of the current graph structure rather than from within predefined areal polygons.

An initial refined concept explored an iterative Delaunay approach.
This process would commence with a global Delaunay triangulation of an initial point set.
In subsequent hierarchical levels, a subset of existing points would be selected as \emph{expansion sites}.
New points would then be sampled in the vicinity of each of these sites.
Following this, a new Delaunay triangulation would be performed, localized to the region around these newly added points and their respective expansion sites, and then integrated into the larger graph structure.
This iterative process aimed to simulate a \enquote{rich get richer} phenomenon: regions with a higher density of points would be more likely to have their constituent points selected as expansion sites for subsequent levels, leading to further concentrated growth in those areas.
This recursive generation would continue for a specified number of levels.
As a final step, a planarization process, as described in \cref{alg:planarization}, would be applied: edges, interpreted as straight line segments, are checked for intersections. Any intersections found are resolved by introducing new vertices at these points and subdividing the original edges accordingly.
This method showed initial promise in creating structures that could yield separators with scaling behavior similar to that of road networks.

Building upon insights from this iterative strategy, we developed a more streamlined and effective method, which is the primary focus of this section.
Instead of performing Delaunay triangulations at each hierarchical level followed by a final planarization step, we first generate the complete set of points across all desired levels.
Only after all points have been generated is a single, global Delaunay triangulation performed on the entire final point set.
The pseudocode for this hierarchical Delaunay generation process is detailed in \cref{alg:hierarchical_delaunay}.

A deliberate design choice in our hierarchical point generation process (\cref{alg:hierarchical_delaunay}) is that candidates for new expansion sites at each level \(i\) are selected from the \emph{entire} set of currently existing points \(P\), rather than exclusively from points generated in the immediately preceding level \(i-1\).
This approach reflects the real-world phenomenon where new settlements, even smaller ones, can emerge around and connect to established, major infrastructure hubs that might have formed at much earlier stages of network growth; for instance, a small town developing near a major motorway interchange.
We also experimented with an alternative strategy where expansion sites for a given level were chosen only from the points generated in the previous level.
However, this restriction did not yield any noticeable differences in the overall structural properties or separator characteristics of the resulting graphs, thus validating our choice of the more inclusive selection method.

\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Pruning}
\label{sec:synthetic:hierarchical_delaunay:pruning}


Analogous to the delaunay triangulation approach in \cref{sec:synthetic:delaunay}, the global Delaunay triangulation performed in \cref{alg:hierarchical_delaunay} results in a graph with an average vertex degree of approximately 6, which is denser than typical road networks.

To better emulate the characteristics of real road networks, such as an average degree around \(2.5\) and fewer nodes with very high degrees, we apply an edge pruning step.
While Bauer et al. \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010} also suggested a pruning methodology, we adopt a different strategy tailored to our generated graph structures.
In our approach, edges are considered in order of increasing Euclidean length (shortest first).
An edge \((u,v)\) is removed if the shortest path distance between \(u\) and \(v\) in the graph, after the hypothetical removal of \((u,v)\), is no more than a factor \(\alpha\) times the original direct length of \((u,v)\); i.e., if \( \text{dist}_{G \setminus \{(u,v)\}}(u,v) \le \alpha \cdot \text{length}(u,v) \).
Through experimentation, we found that a pruning parameter of \(\alpha = 2.5\) effectively reduces the average degree to the target range comparable to that of road networks.
The pseudocode for this edge pruning process is given in \cref{alg:prune_edges}.
A visual comparison of graph structures before and after pruning is provided in \cref{fig:delaunay_vs_no_pruning_graph}.

\begin{algorithm}[tbhp]

            \(G \longleftarrow G \setminus \{(u, v)\}\)\;
        }
    }
    \caption{Edge pruning based on path length redundancy.}
    \label{alg:prune_edges}

    \caption{Visual comparison of a hierarchical Delaunay graph before and after edge pruning.}
    \label{fig:delaunay_vs_no_pruning_graph}
\end{figure}

The pruning step, while beneficial for achieving a target average degree and a more realistic degree distribution, does not fundamentally alter the asymptotic separator scaling of the generated Delaunay graphs.
\Cref{fig:delaunay_pruned_vs_pre_pruned_sep} illustrates that the separator size scaling remains similar for both pruned and unpruned graphs.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{graphics/delaunay_pre_post_pruning_sep_size.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison of separator size scaling in hierarchical Delaunay graphs before and after the pruning step.}
    \label{fig:delaunay_pruned_vs_pre_pruned_sep}
\end{figure}

Given that sequential pruning can be computationally intensive due to numerous shortest path computations (typically Dijkstra's algorithm, where path precomputation is infeasible as the graph changes), we also explored an approximate parallel version.
In this variant, edges are processed in chunks, often corresponding to the number of available processing threads.
Shortest path computations for all candidate edges within a chunk are performed in parallel, based on the graph state \emph{before} any edges in that chunk are removed.
After all checks for the current chunk are complete, the identified edges are removed simultaneously.
This parallelization introduces an approximation: an edge \((u,v)\) might be removed because its shortest alternative path relied on another edge \((x,y)\) from the same chunk, which is also concurrently identified for removal.
If \((x,y)\) is removed, the true shortest path for \((u,v)\) in the updated graph might have become longer than the \(\alpha \cdot \text{length}(u,v)\) threshold, but this would not be detected as the checks were based on the graph state at the beginning of the chunk processing.
Despite this potential for over-pruning, our empirical results suggest that this approximation has a negligible impact on the final graph structure and its properties.
This outcome is likely because edges are sorted by length before being chunked; thus, edges within a single chunk are often spatially distributed across the graph rather than being highly locally interdependent, minimizing negative interference from concurrent removals.

\paragraph{Parameterization}
The number of hierarchical layers, denoted \(L\), is a key parameter for the generation process detailed in \cref{alg:hierarchical_delaunay}.
Drawing from observations of real road networks and prior work on synthetic graph generation \cite{hutchison_synthetic_2010}, \(L\) is often set to 4, a choice suitable for generating graphs with up to approximately 20 million nodes.
With \(L=4\), the algorithm requires parameters for level expansion fractions \(f_i\), points per expansion site \(k_i\), and expansion radii \(r_i\), for \(i \in [1, L]\), totaling \(3L\) (i.e., 12 for \(L=4\)) parameters.
However, the effective number of free parameters is lower.
The specific value of the first expansion radius, \(r_1\), primarily scales the entire embedding without fundamentally altering its topological structure, effectively reducing the count to 11 if \(r_1\) is fixed or normalized.
Furthermore, the algorithm specifies that the first level expansion fraction \(f_1 = 1.0\) (ensuring the initial point always seeds the first level of expansion), reducing the free parameters to 10.
If a target total number of vertices, \(n_{\text{target}}\), is desired, one additional parameter (e.g., \(k_L\)) can be adjusted to meet this target, potentially leaving 9 free parameters for a 4-layer model.
The total number of points after level \(j\), denoted \(n_j\) (where \(n_0=1\) is the initial seed point, so \(n_1 = k_1 + 1\) represents the total points after the first expansion), is given by the recurrence relation:
\[
n_j =
\begin{cases}
k_1 + 1 & \text{if } j=1 \\
n_{j-1} + n_{j-1} \cdot f_j \cdot k_j & \text{if } j > 1 \text{ and } j \le L
\end{cases}
\]
For example, for a 4-layer generation (\(L=4\)), the total number of points \(n_4\) is calculated iteratively:
\begin{align*}
n_1 &= k_1 + 1 \\
n_2 &= n_1 + n_1 \cdot f_2 \cdot k_2 \\
n_3 &= n_2 + n_2 \cdot f_3 \cdot k_3 \\
n_4 &= n_3 + n_3 \cdot f_4 \cdot k_4
\end{align*}
The final graph size is thus \(n_L\).

\paragraph{Parameter Interplay and Heuristics for Separator Properties}
Achieving road network-like separator scaling with the hierarchical Delaunay generator involves a nuanced interplay between the expansion fractions \(f_i\), points per site \(k_i\), and expansion radii \(r_i\).
A critical aspect for developing well-behaved separators appears to be ensuring sufficient interaction or \emph{overlap} between regions expanded from different sites.
This helps to avoid overly simplistic connections between hierarchical components, which can lead to pronounced local minima in separator scaling plots.

It is observed that decreasing expansion radii \(r_i\) contributes to desirable separator properties.
The median edge length in a Delaunay triangulation of \(n\) points within a region of radius \(r\) scales as \(r \cdot n^{-1/2}\).
Thus, to maintain somewhat consistent local geometric scales as density increases within nested expansions (if \(k_i\) is relatively stable), \(r_i\) generally needs to decrease.
Our empirical observations suggested that without an exponential decrease in radii across levels, achieving consistently small separators was not possible.

However, if radii become too small too quickly, the graph might develop insufficient connectivity between clusters originating from different parent sites.
Consider a thought experiment: if each expansion site has an infinitesimally small influence radius for generating points for the next level, these new points primarily connect among themselves and back to their parent site from the higher level.
The number of points on the effective \enquote{perimeter} of such an expanded site (those able to connect to other, distant parts of the graph) may grow much slower than the number of points generated internally, thereby keeping its external connectivity limited; this effect is amplified by the hierarchical sampling which tends to concentrate points internally.
In such a scenario, one might find a separator for the graph defined by the top-level points (e.g., \(n_1\) points after the first level) with a size scaling as \bigOSmall{n_1^{1/2}}.
If each of these top-level separator nodes is a gateway to a large hierarchical substructure that is only sparsely connected back to this top-level framework (via few \enquote{perimeter} connections or the gateway node itself), the separator for the entire graph \(G_L\) might be estimated based on this top-level cut, extended by these few perimeter vertices.
Given that the total number of nodes \(n_L\) is typically much larger than \(n_1\), such a separator (e.g., related to a \bigOSmall{n_1^{1/2}} scaling) would likely be disproportionately small for \(n_L\).
This issue can also manifest at subsequent levels.
An attempt to achieve a desired global \bigOSmall{n_L^{1/3}} scaling can involve setting parameters so that the initial \bigOSmall{n_1^{1/2}} separator scaling corresponds to this overall target.
This, however, can lead to a different problem: distinct top-level expansion sites, even if spatially close, might end up connected by very few paths.
This sparse inter-connectivity between major components results in the re-emergence of pronounced local minima in the separator scaling plots at transitions between hierarchical levels, an issue similar to that encountered in simpler nested grid or Voronoi generation schemes where components are too easily fractured.
Therefore, for generating graphs with well-behaved separators, it is critical that the expansion areas originating from different sites \emph{overlap} or interact sufficiently to build an integrated and robustly connected graph structure, rather than a collection of dense clusters weakly linked through a sparse higher-level skeleton. \todo{possibly needs graphical illustration}

The degree of spatial overlap between regions expanded from different sites is fundamental to achieving desirable separator characteristics, as it dictates the strength of connectivity between hierarchical components.
The parameters \(f_i\), \(k_i\), and \(r_i\) jointly determine this overlap:
A higher expansion fraction \(f_i\) results in a greater number of nodes from the parent level being selected as expansion sites.
This reduces the average distance between chosen sites, causing their respective areas of influence for the current level to naturally adjoin or overlap significantly.
Increasing \(k_i\), the number of points generated per expansion site, primarily makes each local cluster denser.
Such high local density implies that partitioning these individual dense regions themselves requires larger separators, reflecting their increased internal complexity.
Simultaneously, by populating the same expansion radius \(r_i\) with more points, the average distances between points decrease on this level, increasing the likelihood of inter-cluster connections.
The effect of the expansion radius \(r_i\) is direct: a larger radius straightforwardly increases the spatial extent of each new cluster, leading to more substantial overlap with adjacent expansion zones and, consequently, also contributing to larger overall separators due to increased linkage.
Radii at deeper hierarchical levels must also be scaled appropriately relative to those at higher levels to ensure desired structural properties and avoid unintended consequences on separator sizes.
Therefore, a careful balance of these parameters—\(f_i, k_i,\) and \(r_i\)—is essential to cultivate a graph structure with the intended connectivity and separator properties.

The parameterization offers flexibility.
For instance, to simulate prominent \enquote{urban centers} at higher levels, a larger initial radius \(r_1\) might be employed.
This would typically be balanced by adjusting subsequent parameters, such as reducing \(f_2\) (selecting fewer centers from the points generated by these large initial expansions), to maintain overall structural integrity and desired separator characteristics.
However, such compensations have practical limits; if radii do not shrink sufficiently across levels, adjustments to \(f_i\) or \(k_i\) may not fully mitigate adverse effects on separator scaling.

For generating structures visually akin to road networks, allowing the number of active expansion sites (primarily controlled by \(f_i\)) to decrease at deeper hierarchical levels often yields favorable results.
This complements the inherent tendency of the generation process where all existing points are candidates for seeding new expansions (the \enquote{rich get richer} effect), helping to manage density while still fostering hierarchical differentiation.
Plausible structures can emerge even with constant \(k_i\) values across levels, provided \(f_i\) and \(r_i\) are appropriately tuned.
For instance, the parameter set comprising level expansion fractions \(f_i = (1.0, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)\), points per expansion site \(k_i = (50, 50, 50, 50)\), and expansion radii \(r_i = (1000, 424, 120, 17)\) produces graphs whose separator characteristics are illustrated in \Cref{fig:hier_delaunay_example_params_sep}.

To further illustrate the interplay of these parameters, \Cref{fig:hier_delaunay_param_interplay} presents separator scaling plots for four different parameter configurations.
The baseline configuration, shown in \cref{fig:param_interplay_baseline}, is chosen to produce separators with characteristics similar to those observed in real road networks.
\Cref{fig:param_interplay_low_f2} then demonstrates the impact of significantly decreasing the expansion fraction for the second level (\(f_2\)) while other parameters are held constant relative to the baseline; this results in a notable drop in separator sizes, indicative of a less interconnected structure.
Subsequently, \cref{fig:param_interplay_fix1_radii} shows that this reduction in separator size due to a low \(f_2\) can be counteracted by proportionally increasing the expansion radius of the second level (\(r_2\)) and the subsequent radii (\(r_3, r_4\)).
Alternatively, \cref{fig:param_interplay_fix2_k1} illustrates that increasing the number of points generated at the first level (\(k_1\)) can also compensate for the reduced \(f_2\), again achieving separator scaling similar to the baseline by enhancing overall density and connectivity from the initial expansion phase.
